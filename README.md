# Introduction
SQL Data Warehouse Project using PostgreSQL (running in a Docker container). This project uses the medallion architecture.

## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture
The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture  **Bronze**,  **Silver**, and  **Gold**  layers:  [![Data Architecture](https://github.com/tharrmeehan/SQL-Data-Warehouse-Project/raw/main/docs/data_architecture.png)](https://github.com/tharrmeehan/SQL-Data-Warehouse-Project/blob/main/docs/data_architecture.png)

1.  **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database. There are 6 different data sources.
2.  **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3.  **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
